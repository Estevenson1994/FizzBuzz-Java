## FizzBuzz in Java

This is my attempt at learning a new langauge and then test driving a basic fizzbuzz program.

Since this week I was learning how to write a testing framework from scratch, I thought I would give this a go usuing java as well.

You can find my basic tests in `FizzBuzzTest.java` and my implementation in `FizzBuzzConverter.java`.

#Set Instructions

These instructions are assuming you have java installed:

```
- Clone this repo
- cd fizzbuzz-java
- compile the files running `javac FizzBuzzTest.java FizzBuzzConverter.java'
- This will create the two class files `FizzBuzzTest.class` and `FizzBuzzConverter.class`
- run the tests by running `java FizzBuzzTest`

```
